# Introduction

Welcome to the V-Factory Portal API Documentation! 

The V-factory Portal API allows you to perform operations on the V-Factory system.

V-Factory Portal API is built using REST principles which ensures predictable URLs that makes writing applications easy. 
This API follows HTTP rules, enabling a wide range of HTTP clients which can be used to interact with the API.

Every resource is exposed as a URL. The URL of each resource can be obtained by accessing the API Root Endpoint [https://v-factory.omniship.eu/api/portal/v1/](https://app.v-factory.omniship.eu/api/portal/v1).

For example the Sales Orders resource is reachable at [https://v-factory.omniship.eu/api/portal/v1/sales_orders](https://v-factory.omniship.eu/api/portal/v1/sales_orders).
